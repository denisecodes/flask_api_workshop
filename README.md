# Creating RESTFUL APIS using Python and Flask

As part of the API Mastery Workshop hosted by Enoch Osarenren, the first session focused on creating RESTful APIs using Python and Flask, and testing them using Postman.

## Getting Started

To run the Python file (`api.py`) provided in this workshop, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Flask:** Install Flask by using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

### Running the API

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `api.py` is located.
3. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python api.py
    ```

## Testing the API

Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to test the APIs created with the Python Flask framework. Postman allows you to send requests to the API endpoints, inspect the responses, and test various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

1. Open Postman.
2. Create a new request with the appropriate HTTP method and the API endpoint URL.
3. Send the request and observe the response.

## Additional Information

- The `api.py` file contains the implementation of the RESTful APIs using Flask. Feel free to explore and modify it as part of the workshop learnings.
- For further details on Flask, refer to the [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).
